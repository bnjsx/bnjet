<!--
  This file is only required if you try to open the Vite server directly (http://localhost:5173/).
  Instead, you should open http://localhost:2025/ to interact with the BNJSX server.

  - In development: BNJSX server communicates with the Vite server to fetch assets for a better dev experience.
  - In production: The BNJSX server serves the assets directly without using Vite.

  You do not need to interact with Vite directly.
